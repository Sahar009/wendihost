# Plesk Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
Your Next.js application wasn't starting on Plesk because:
1. No `server.js` file in the root directory (only existed in `src/`)
2. The `start` script in `package.json` used `next start` which requires the app to be pre-built
3. Configuration was set to localhost only, which doesn't work on hosting servers

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `server.js` in Root Directory
- **File:** `server.js` (root level)
- **Purpose:** Custom Node.js server for Next.js
- **Key Features:**
  - Listens on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) instead of `localhost`
  - Configurable port via `PORT` environment variable
  - Automatically sets `NODE_ENV=production` if not set
  - Compatible with Plesk hosting

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- **Changed:** `start` script now runs `node server.js` instead of `next start`
- **Added:** `start:next` script for standard Next.js start (as fallback)
- **Added:** `plesk:setup` script for easy setup

### 3. Updated `create-deployment-package.js`
- **Added:** `server.js` to the list of files included in deployment package

### 4. Created Documentation
- **PLESK_DEPLOYMENT.md:** Comprehensive deployment guide
- **PLESK_QUICK_START.md:** Quick checklist for deployment
- **PLESK_SUMMARY.md:** This summary file

## How to Deploy on Plesk

### Quick Steps:

1. **Push changes to Git** (if using Git deployment)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Plesk deployment configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **In Plesk, pull the latest code** (or upload files if not using Git)

3. **Run in Plesk terminal:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/vhosts/yourdomain.com/httpdocs
   npm install
   npx prisma generate
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Configure in Plesk Node.js settings:**
   - Application startup file: `server.js`
   - Application mode: Production
   - Node.js version: 18.x or higher

5. **Add environment variables:**
   - `DATABASE_URL` (your PostgreSQL connection string)
   - Any other required variables
   - `PORT` (optional, defaults to 3000)

6. **Start the application** in Plesk

## Important Notes

✅ The `server.js` now exists in the root directory  
✅ `npm start` now works correctly on Plesk  
✅ Application listens on all network interfaces  
✅ Production mode is automatically set  
✅ Port is configurable via environment variable  

## Testing Locally

You can test the production setup locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `server.js` (NEW - root directory)
2. ✅ `package.json` (MODIFIED - updated start script)
3. ✅ `create-deployment-package.js` (MODIFIED - added server.js)
4. ✅ `PLESK_DEPLOYMENT.md` (NEW)
5. ✅ `PLESK_QUICK_START.md` (NEW)

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Follow the steps in `PLESK_QUICK_START.md` for deployment
3. Monitor your application logs in Plesk
4. Verify your website is working
